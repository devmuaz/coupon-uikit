The example contains these widgets built using this package

## Usage

There are two ways to get started:

- Using the provided built-in widget `CouponCard` class that has a different properties, so you don't do anything else.
- Using the provided clipper `CouponClipper` class which in this case if you want to implement the widget your self but you just need a clipper to do that.
